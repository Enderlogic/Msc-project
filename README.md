An easy solution of PPC test for Gaussian process

Run solution_v2.m to get started. 

All of the configuration parameters are listed in the "Setting for data, model and PPC" section.

After acquiring the posterior samples of parameters, you can run the prior_posterior.m to get a plot of the prior and posterior distribution of parameters in the model.
